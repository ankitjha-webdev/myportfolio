<h1>About Me</h1>
<pre>I am a second-year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering @ CENTURION UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, Odisha Paralakhemundi Campus. I am always ready to have new experiences, meet new people and learn new things. I find the idea of creating value for people and impacting the world through my work gratifying.


♦ In addition, I know PHP and Python which helps me serve the real-life of coding.

I am very interested in AI & ML and it's amazing to learn about its applications in various fields like crime detection, predicting diseases like cancer and Parkinson's, use of Big Data to target ads, self-driving cars, creation of unique art and music. I would be proficient in Python.

✔ I love Web Development and, Android App Development.

✔ I enjoy challenges that enable me to grow. I like to find application in what is taught to me and use Feynman and Pomodoro techniques to learn as quickly as possible.

✔ Having lived all around the country and meeting a lot of people, I'm able to adapt to any surrounding or circumstance.
