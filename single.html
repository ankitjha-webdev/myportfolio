          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>
            Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of machine learning generally is to
            understand the structure of data and fit that data into models that can be understood and utilized by
            people.
            <br>
            Although machine learning is a field within computer science, it differs from traditional computational
            approaches. In traditional computing, algorithms are sets of explicitly programmed instructions used by
            computers to calculate or problem solve. Machine learning algorithms instead allow for computers to train on
            data inputs and use statistical analysis in order to output values that fall within a specific range.
            Because of this, machine learning facilitates computers in building models from sample data in order to
            automate decision-making processes based on data inputs.
            <br>
            Any technology user today has benefitted from machine learning. Facial recognition technology allows social
            media platforms to help users tag and share photos of friends. Optical character recognition (OCR)
            technology converts images of text into movable type. Recommendation engines, powered by machine learning,
            suggest what movies or television shows to watch next based on user preferences. Self-driving cars that rely
            on machine learning to navigate may soon be available to consumers.
            <br>
            Machine learning is a continuously developing field. Because of this, there are some considerations to keep
            in mind as you work with machine learning methodologies, or analyze the impact of machine learning
            processes.
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/maching.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p> In this tutorial, we’ll look into the common machine learning methods of supervised and unsupervised
            learning, and common algorithmic approaches in machine learning, including the k-nearest neighbor algorithm,
            decision tree learning, and deep learning. We’ll explore which programming languages are most used in
            machine learning, providing you with some of the positive and negative attributes of each. Additionally,
            we’ll discuss biases that are perpetuated by machine learning algorithms, and consider what can be kept in
            mind to prevent these biases when building algorithms </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Machine Learning Methods </h2>
          <p>In machine learning, tasks are generally classified into broad categories. These categories are based on
            how learning is received or how feedback on the learning is given to the system developed.
            <br>
            Two of the most widely adopted machine learning methods are supervised learning which trains algorithms
            based on example input and output data that is labeled by humans, and unsupervised learning which provides
            the algorithm with no labeled data in order to allow it to find structure within its input data. Let’s
            explore these methods in more detail</p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <h5>Supervised Learning</h5>
          <p>In supervised learning, the computer is provided with example inputs that are labeled with their desired
            outputs. The purpose of this method is for the algorithm to be able to “learn” by comparing its actual
            output with the “taught” outputs to find errors, and modify the model accordingly. Supervised learning
            therefore uses patterns to predict label values on additional unlabeled data.</p>
          <p>For example, with supervised learning, an algorithm may be fed data with images of sharks labeled as fish
            and images of oceans labeled as water. By being trained on this data, the supervised learning algorithm
            should be able to later identify unlabeled shark images as fish and unlabeled ocean images as water.</p>
          <p>A common use case of supervised learning is to use historical data to predict statistically likely future
            events. It may use historical stock market information to anticipate upcoming fluctuations, or be employed
            to filter out spam emails. In supervised learning, tagged photos of dogs can be used as input data to
            classify untagged photos of dogs</p>

          <h5>Unsupervised Learning
          </h5>
          <p>In unsupervised learning, data is unlabeled, so the learning algorithm is left to find commonalities among
            its input data. As unlabeled data are more abundant than labeled data, machine learning methods that
            facilitate unsupervised learning are particularly valuable. <br>

            The goal of unsupervised learning may be as straightforward as discovering hidden patterns within a dataset,
            but it may also have a goal of feature learning, which allows the computational machine to automatically
            discover the representations that are needed to classify raw data. <br>

            Unsupervised learning is commonly used for transactional data. You may have a large dataset of customers and
            their purchases, but as a human you will likely not be able to make sense of what similar attributes can be
            drawn from customer profiles and their types of purchases. With this data fed into an unsupervised learning
            algorithm, it may be determined that women of a certain age range who buy unscented soaps are likely to be
            pregnant, and therefore a marketing campaign related to pregnancy and baby products can be targeted to this
            audience in order to increase their number of purchases.
            <br>
            Without being told a “correct” answer, unsupervised learning methods can look at complex data that is more
            expansive and seemingly unrelated in order to organize it in potentially meaningful ways. Unsupervised
            learning is often used for anomaly detection including for fraudulent credit card purchases, and recommender
            systems that recommend what products to buy next. In unsupervised learning, untagged photos of dogs can be
            used as input data for the algorithm to find likenesses and classify dog photos together.</p>
          <h5>Approaches</h5>
          <p>As a field, machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, so having a background
            knowledge in statistics is useful for understanding and leveraging machine learning algorithms.
            <br>
            For those who may not have studied statistics, it can be helpful to first define correlation and regression,
            as they are commonly used techniques for investigating the relationship among quantitative variables.
            Correlation is a measure of association between two variables that are not designated as either dependent or
            independent. Regression at a basic level is used to examine the relationship between one dependent and one
            independent variable. Because regression statistics can be used to anticipate the dependent variable when
            the independent variable is known, regression enables prediction capabilities.
            <br>
            Approaches to machine learning are continuously being developed. For our purposes, we’ll go through a few of
            the popular approaches that are being used in machine learning at the time of writing.</p>
          <h5>k-nearest neighbor
          </h5>
          <p>The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is a pattern recognition model that can be used for classification as well
            as regression. Often abbreviated as k-NN, the k in k-nearest neighbor is a positive integer, which is
            typically small. In either classification or regression, the input will consist of the k closest training
            examples within a space.
            <br>
            We will focus on k-NN classification. In this method, the output is class membership. This will assign a new
            object to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors. In the case of k = 1, the object is assigned
            to the class of the single nearest neighbor.
            <br>
            Let’s look at an example of k-nearest neighbor. In the diagram below, there are blue diamond objects and
            orange star objects. These belong to two separate classes: the diamond class and the star class.
            <br>When a new object is added to the space — in this case a green heart — we will want the machine learning
            algorithm to classify the heart to a certain class. <br>When a new object is added to the space — in this
            case a green heart — we will want the machine learning algorithm to classify the heart to a certain class.
            <br>Among the most basic of machine learning algorithms, k-nearest neighbor is considered to be a type of
            “lazy learning” as generalization beyond the training data does not occur until a query is made to the
            system.</p>
          <h5>Decision Tree Learning
          </h5>
          <p>For general use, decision trees are employed to visually represent decisions and show or inform decision
            making. When working with machine learning and data mining, decision trees are used as a predictive model.
            These models map observations about data to conclusions about the data’s target value.
            <br>
            The goal of decision tree learning is to create a model that will predict the value of a target based on
            input variables.
            <br>
            In the predictive model, the data’s attributes that are determined through observation are represented by
            the branches, while the conclusions about the data’s target value are represented in the leaves.
            <br>
            When “learning” a tree, the source data is divided into subsets based on an attribute value test, which is
            repeated on each of the derived subsets recursively. Once the subset at a node has the equivalent value as
            its target value has, the recursion process will be complete.
            <br>
            Let’s look at an example of various conditions that can determine whether or not someone should go fishing.
            This includes weather conditions as well as barometric pressure conditions.

          <h5>Deep Learning
          </h5>
          <p>Deep learning attempts to imitate how the human brain can process light and sound stimuli into vision and
            hearing. A deep learning architecture is inspired by biological neural networks and consists of multiple
            layers in an artificial neural network made up of haProgramming Languages
            rdware and GPUs.
            <br>
            Deep learning uses a cascade of nonlinear processing unit layers in order to extract or transform features
            (or representations) of the data. The output of one layer serves as the input of the successive layer. In
            deep learning, algorithms can be either supervised and serve to classify data, or unsupervised and perform
            pattern analysis.
            <br>
            Among the machine learning algorithms that are currently being used and developed, deep learning absorbs the
            most data and has been able to beat humans in some cognitive tasks. Because of these attributes, deep
            learning has become the approach with significant potential in the artificial intelligence space
            <br>
            Computer vision and speech recognition have both realized significant advances from deep learning
            approaches. IBM Watson is a well-known example of a system that leverages deep learning.</p>

          <h5>Programming Languages
          </h5>
          <p>When choosing a language to specialize in with machine learning, you may want to consider the skills listed
            on current job advertisements as well as libraries available in various languages that can be used for
            machine learning processes.
            <br>
            From data taken from job ads on indeed.com in December 2016, it can be inferred that Python is the most
            sought-for programming language in the machine learning professional field. Python is followed by Java, then
            R, then C++.
            <br>
            Python’s popularity may be due to the increased development of deep learning frameworks available for this
            language recently, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. As a language that has readable syntax and the
            ability to be used as a scripting language, Python proves to be powerful and straightforward both for
            preprocessing data and working with data directly. The scikit-learn machine learning library is built on top
            of several existing Python packages that Python developers may already be familiar with, namely NumPy,
            SciPy, and Matplotlib.
            <br>
            To get started with Python, you can read our tutorial series on “How To Code in Python 3,” or read
            specifically on “How To Build a Machine Learning Classifier in Python with scikit-learn” or “How To Perform
            Neural Style Transfer with Python 3 and PyTorch.”
            <br>
            Java is widely used in enterprise programming, and is generally used by front-end desktop application
            developers who are also working on machine learning at the enterprise level. Usually it is not the first
            choice for those new to programming who want to learn about machine learning, but is favored by those with a
            background in Java development to apply to machine learning. In terms of machine learning applications in
            industry, Java tends to be used more than Python for network security, including in cyber attack and fraud
            detection use cases.
            <br>
            Among machine learning libraries for Java are Deeplearning4j, an open-source and distributed deep-learning
            library written for both Java and Scala; MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit) allows for machine
            learning applications on text, including natural language processing, topic modeling, document
            classification, and clustering; and Weka, a collection of machine learning algorithms to use for data mining
            tasks.
            <br>
            R is an open-source programming language used primarily for statistical computing. It has grown in
            popularity over recent years, and is favored by many in academia. R is not typically used in industry
            production environments, but has risen in industrial applications due to increased interest in data science.
            Popular packages for machine learning in R include caret (short for Classification And REgression Training)
            for creating predictive models, randomForest for classification and regression, and e1071 which includes
            functions for statistics and probability theory.
            <br>
            C++ is the language of choice for machine learning and artificial intelligence in game or robot applications
            (including robot locomotion). Embedded computing hardware developers and electronics engineers are more
            likely to favor C++ or C in machine learning applications due to their proficiency and level of control in
            the language. Some machine learning libraries you can use with C++ include the scalable mlpack, Dlib
            offering wide-ranging machine learning algorithms, and the modular and open-source Shark.</p>
          <h5>Human Biases
          </h5>
          <p>Although data and computational analysis may make us think that we are receiving objective information,
            this is not the case; being based on data does not mean that machine learning outputs are neutral. Human
            bias plays a role in how data is collected, organized, and ultimately in the algorithms that determine how
            machine learning will interact with that data.
            <br>
            If, for example, people are providing images for “fish” as data to train an algorithm, and these people
            overwhelmingly select images of goldfish, a computer may not classify a shark as a fish. This would create a
            bias against sharks as fish, and sharks would not be counted as fish.
            <br>
            When using historical photographs of scientists as training data, a computer may not properly classify
            scientists who are also people of color or women. In fact, recent peer-reviewed research has indicated that
            AI and machine learning programs exhibit human-like biases that include race and gender prejudices. See, for
            example “Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases” and “Men Also Like
            Shopping: Reducing Gender Bias Amplification using Corpus-level Constraints” [PDF].
            <br>
            As machine learning is increasingly leveraged in business, uncaught biases can perpetuate systemic issues
            that may prevent people from qualifying for loans, from being shown ads for high-paying job opportunities,
            or from receiving same-day delivery options.
            <br>
            Because human bias can negatively impact others, it is extremely important to be aware of it, and to also
            work towards eliminating it as much as possible. One way to work towards achieving this is by ensuring that
            there are diverse people working on a project and that diverse people are testing and reviewing it. Others
            have called for regulatory third parties to monitor and audit algorithms, building alternative systems that
            can detect biases, and ethics reviews as part of data science project planning. Raising awareness about
            biases, being mindful of our own unconscious biases, and structuring equity in our machine learning projects
            and pipelines can work to combat bias in this field.</p>
          <h5>Conclusion
          </h5>
          <p>This tutorial reviewed some of the use cases of machine learning, common methods and popular approaches
            used in the field, suitable machine learning programming languages, and also covered some things to keep in
            mind in terms of unconscious biases being replicated in algorithms.
            <br>
            Because machine learning is a field that is continuously being innovated, it is important to keep in mind
            that algorithms, methods, and approaches will continue to change.
